        <title>The Best of Hi and Lois</title>
        <description>Since its debut in 1954, &lt;i&gt;Hi and Lois&lt;/i&gt;, the quintessential family comic strip, has chronicled the changing (and yet unchanging) life of the American family. Hi, Lois, Chip, Dot, Ditto, and Trixie (sitting in her sunbeam) have tracked the daily life of the baby boomers and their folks, from the trials and pleasures of good old family life to the passing fancies of the day-coonskin caps to video games. Readers, who once followed the strip from Chip and Dot's angle, as kids, now see things more from Hi and Lois's point of view, as parents shepherding their own families along. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For 32 years two of the great comic-strip masters of our time-Mort "Beetle Bailey" Walker and Dik "HÃ¤gar the Horrible" Browne-have worked together to make this one of the most enduringly popular and widely read strips. It appears in over 1,000 newspapers daily, and is one of the half dozen most popular strips in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Best of Hi and Lois&lt;/i&gt; is truly the ultimate collection. With close to 300 daily strips and more than 80 Sunday pages from 1954 to present, plus special drawings and a behind-the-scenes look at how the strip is created, it forms an affectionately funny retrospective on four different decades of American family life. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hi and Lois&lt;/i&gt; is the result of a classic collaboration between &lt;b&gt;Mort Walker&lt;/b&gt;, who writes the strip, and &lt;b&gt;Dik Browne&lt;/b&gt;, who draws it. &lt;i&gt;The Best of Hi and Lois&lt;/i&gt; completes a trilogy that presents the best of their work.</description>
