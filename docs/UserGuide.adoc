== Introduction

=== What is Bibliotek

Bibliotek is a free book cataloguing application that is simple, fast and easy to use.
You can use Bibliotek to search for books, manage your reading list and track the availability of your books.

If you *prefer to use a desktop app*, like *working with a Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or can *type fast*, Bibliotek is just for you!

Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

[[addalias-command]]

[TIP]
You can use command aliases to specify default named parameters (parameters with a prefix, such as `t/TITLE`). +
For example, if you want a custom `list` command that sorts by rating by default,
you can add a command alias using `addalias ls cmd/list by/rating`. +
You can override this default sort mode by specifying a different sort mode, e.g. `ls by/status`.

Examples:

* `addalias rm cmd/delete` +
Adds a command alias with the name `rm`. +
You can then use `rm INDEX` in place of `delete INDEX`.
