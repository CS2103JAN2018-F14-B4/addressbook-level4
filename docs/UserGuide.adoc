== Introduction

=== What is Bibliotek

Bibliotek is a free book cataloguing application that is simple, fast and easy to use.
You can use Bibliotek to search for books, manage your reading list and track the availability of your books.

If you *prefer to use a desktop app*, like *working with a Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or can *type fast*, Bibliotek is just for you!

Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters you supply e.g. in `search t/TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter which you can use as `search t/Harry Potter`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g you can use `[t/TITLE] [a/AUTHOR]` as `t/Harry Potter a/Rowling` or as `t/Harry Potter` (but there cannot be no parameters).
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times, including zero times. For example, you can use `[a/AUTHOR]...` as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `a/Dubner`, `a/Dubner a/Steven Levitt`, etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. For example, if the command specifies `a/AUTHOR t/TITLE`, `t/TITLE a/AUTHOR` is acceptable.

=== Viewing help : `help`

If you are unsure of some commands, use the `help` command to open this document. +
Format: `help`

=== Searching for books online: `search`

If you want to find any books with `Harry Potter` as keyword, enter `search Harry Potter`.

Bibliotek shows `Searching for matching books...` to indicate that your `search` is being processed.
This may take some time since an external service is being called to fetch your search results.

When your search results are ready, Bibliotek shows `Found xx matching books.` and displays your
search results in the left panel.

image::SearchCommandFound.png[width="700"]

NOTE: If Bibliotek shows `Failed to retrieve information from online.`, it means your search request has timed out.
You should try again after some time.

Other examples:

Returns a list of books related to `Artemis`, where `Andy Weir` matches one of the authors.
* `search t/Babylon's Ashes c/Science Fiction` +

If you want to add `Harry Potter and the Classical World` to your book shelf, enter `add 2`.

image::DeleteCommand.png[width="700"]

If you regret your deletion and wish to undo it, enter `undo`.

Bibliotek shows `Undo success!` to indicate that your `undo` is successful. `Harry Potter and the Classical World` is back in your

you can add a command alias to reduce the amount of typing needed. +

****
* Adds a command alias for the specified `COMMAND`.
* `COMMAND` should refer to a default, built-in command, and can optionally include command parameters.

****

WARNING: If `COMMAND` does not specify a valid built-in command, you will
get an `Unknown command` message when you attempt to use the command alias.

[TIP]
You can use command aliases to specify default named parameters (parameters with a prefix, such as `t/TITLE`). +
For example, if you want a custom `list` command that sorts by title (in reverse alphabetical order) by default,
you can add a command alias using `addalias ls cmd/list by/titled`. +
You can override this default sort mode by specifying a different sort mode, e.g. `ls by/status`.

Examples:

* `addalias rm cmd/delete` +
Adds a command alias with the name `rm`. +
You can then use `rm INDEX` in place of `delete INDEX`.

* `addalias read cmd/edit s/read p/none` +
Adds a command alias with the name `read`. +
You can then use `read INDEX` in place of `edit INDEX s/read p/none`.

the `aliases` command to view all your command aliases. +

Format: `deletealias ALIAS_NAME`

* Deletes the command alias specified by the `ALIAS_NAME`.
* `ALIAS_NAME` is case-insensitive, and must match the name of an existing alias.
****

Examples:

* `deletealias rm` +
Deletes the command alias with the name `rm`.
* `deletealias read` +
Deletes the command alias with the name `read`.

=== Changing theme : `theme` [since v1.2]
